# Habbo‚≠ê

HabboStar is an open source Habbo CMS with extensibility in mind. A few distinctive features are:
- Extensibility. Features are very easily added.
- Customizable. From custom traditional themes to SPA themes. 
- Simplicity. The architecture is well-defined with clear boundaries and should be relatively easy to understand.
- Stable. Code has clear architectural boundaries and the code is reasonably tested.
- Easily installable. Install HabboStar as a Docker container or on the machine with an easy-to-understand installation script.

In addition, Cosmic, Ares or - are you insane? - BrainCMS users can migrate their current system without any trouble.

Please note that HabboStar is in active development, thus incomplete. Distinct features may or may not be visible, depending
on the development speed.

There are additional features not in the list. You can read the wiki for more information.  

### Installation and configuration
